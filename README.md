# SBL Quiz App – Wrong Answer Fix

This project addresses the **“Wrong Answer” feature** in an SBL quiz app.  
- Fixed an issue where the score incorrectly increased by 2 instead of 1.  
- Score calculation now always starts from step 1 to prevent errors.  
- Other app functionalities remain unchanged and work as intended.

For a detailed **user guide** and full details on how this app was created, please refer to the `簡報3.pptx` file and [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ENIyY1KVQNmHXxKXK5O86Ik6g81UCidp/view?usp=sharing) in the repository.
