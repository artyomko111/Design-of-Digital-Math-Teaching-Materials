# SBL Quiz App

This project implements a math learning app combining **simulation-based learning (SBL)** and **drill-and-practice exercises**.  
- **SBL Mode:** Step-by-step problem solving with voice guidance and visualizations (canvas) for each step. Example: Oranges cost 8 units each; sister buys 4, younger sister buys 3; calculate total. Randomized examples and challenge mode included.  
- **Drill Mode:** Step 1 addition, Step 2 multiplication, answer with unit, score tracking, hints, wrong answers, and learning time. Buttons: Check Answer, Next Question, Retry.  
- Supports multiple screens with parameter passing.  

This project was created using MIT App Inventor. For a detailed **user guide** and full details on how this app was created, please refer to the `簡報3.pptx` file and [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ENIyY1KVQNmHXxKXK5O86Ik6g81UCidp/view?usp=sharing) in the repository.
